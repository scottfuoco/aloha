# Project 1 - Aloha Apparel

# Summary / Purpose

(http://scottfuoco.github.io/aloha/ "Aloha Apparel") is a mockup of a fictional e-commerce website written in HTML5 and CSS3 without the use of any frameworks.
It can be a useful reference for the following:
* Positioning containers and elements with CSS floats
* Displaying containers and elements using display block and inline-block
* Usage of the CSS position properties relative and absolute
* Importing and rendering custom fonts
* Using media queries to design a website using the Mobile First design principle

# Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

# My Learnings

This project taught me a lot about how to structure semantic HTML in order to effectively and efficiently style a website using CSS.  I also learn by encountering a few of the CSS got'chas with regards to using floats and the position attribute and why CSS frameworks have become an essential part of any web developers tool-kit.  I never expected to be so excited by changing fonts but adding the custom fonts really made me see typography in a new light.  I guess you have to see the text change from the browser default to truly gain an appreciation for how just typography can make a huge difference in the sites look and feel.  The last major learning from this project would have to be the Mobile First approach.  Initially the website was created for just higher resolution screens and trying to move down all of the code into the media queries and then modify then for the mobile version after is a bit confusing and very time consuming when things don't switch over as smoothly as you would hope.  When the site is designed for the smallest resolution or mobile first it is much more intuitive to think about going from a block to inline-block style website in terms of positioning because generally elements in HTML are blocks and that is how you initially start designing.  So to build the mobile first website and then to apply additional CSS rules to continue styling how you normally would is much easier than it is to do the reverse process by removing CSS and going from an inline-block style to block.

# TODO
* Add an image of the website (possibly one of each break point view to the README)
* Add additional comments to style.CSS
* proof read the README.md as I'm too tired to do it now
* fix the description section width for higher resolution screens
